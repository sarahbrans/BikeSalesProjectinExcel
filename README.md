# Data Cleaning and Dashboard Creation in Microsoft Excel

This repository documents the data cleaning and dashboard creation project focused on analyzing bike sales data using Microsoft Excel. The goal of this project was to take raw bike sales data, clean and preprocess it, and create an interactive dashboard for better visualization and analysis.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project was to transform raw bike sales data into a clean, structured format and then create an interactive dashboard to provide insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making. The process involved data cleaning, removing duplicates, fixing column inconsistencies, and modifying data for better analysis.

## Data Cleaning
In the data-cleaning phase, the following steps were performed:

    • Duplicate Removal: Identified and removed duplicate records from
    the dataset to ensure accuracy and avoid duplication of information.

    • Column Standardization: Standardized column names to maintain consistency
    across the dataset. This improved data organization and made it easier to work with.

    • Data Transformation: Created new columns for enhanced analysis. For example,
    age was transformed into age brackets to provide a clearer
    overview of customer demographics.

    • Data Validation: Checked for and corrected erroneous or missing values, 
    ensuring the dataset's reliability and accuracy.

## Dashboard Creation
The dashboard was created to visually represent the insights derived from the cleaned data. It includes the following components:

    • Pivot Tables: Created pivot tables to summarize sales data by 
    various categories such as income by gender, region, and commute distance.

    • Charts and Graphs: Designed interactive charts (bar charts, pie charts, etc.)
    to visualize sales trends, customer demographics, and product preferences.

    • Filters and Slicers: Integrated filters and slicers to enable users to
    dynamically explore and segment data based on different criteria.

    • Key Metrics: Displayed key performance metrics like total revenue, average order 
    value, and customer distribution for a quick overview.

    • Age Brackets: Utilized the transformed age brackets to visualize customer age
    distribution, helping in targeting specific age groups effectively.
